Introduction
Welcome to MAANA
Maana was founded with the vision of using technology to systematize the world’s industrial expertise and data into digital knowledge that could significantly advance the global economy.

In 2013 Maana invented a new way to represent industrial knowledge mathematically, using the Maana Patented Computational Knowledge Graph™.  This unique technology enables industrial companies to encode human expertise and data from across silos into digital knowledge, to enable employees make better and faster decisions.  This unique technology eliminates the need to move data and enables creation of thousands of models at scale, through the re-usability of models across the enterprise.

Our mission is to facilitate the tens of millions of experts working in industrial companies around the world, and give them the ability to make better decisions, faster.  

This guide is intended for Solution Developers and Data Scientists and describes how to develop such services (aka "bots") and applications and operationalize them in a production setting.
